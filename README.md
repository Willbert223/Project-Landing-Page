# Project-Landing-Page
TOP LANDING PAGE
The goal of the project is to make a simple
landing page that is on all websites using flex.
So far with my current skills i was able to do all of the html file by myself without googleing it.  but the css i had to ask chatgpt for some help. but my project is close to what the desired is. the only areas that are wrong are the cta area i did not touch yet. and the header button is not correct the border is square and the desired image one is rounded corners. the cards text is perfectly aligned under the images. and the testimonial is actually done correctly on mine at least it looks right. and i did footer correct.
